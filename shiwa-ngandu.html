                        A three-storey English manor house with Italianate tower, Tuscan courtyard, and private chapel — built entirely by hand in the bush, 640 kilometres from the nearest railhead. Sir Stewart Gore-Browne was no ordinary colonist: he became a mentor to Kenneth Kaunda, championed African self-determination, and remains the only white man ever given a state funeral in Zambia.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>The Story</h2>
                    <p>In 1914, Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Gore-Browne was surveying the border between Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo when he stumbled upon a lake of extraordinary beauty. "We came upon what I thought was the most beautiful lake I had ever seen," he later wrote. "It was surrounded by hilly country, and along its shores were groves of rare trees, of a kind sacred to Africans." The Bena Ng'andu people called it Ishiba Ng'andu — "Lake of the Royal Crocodile" — after ancestors who found a dead crocodile here and took it as an auspicious omen.</p>
                    <p>Gore-Browne purchased 10,000 acres at two shillings per acre and resolved to build his own private kingdom. After fighting in the First World War, he returned in 1920, aged thirty-seven, with an army engineering manual, an Encyclopaedia Britannica, and a model of his aunt's house at Weybridge. Over the following thirty years, in one of the most ambitious building projects Africa had seen, he would create something unprecedented.</p>
                    <p>The site was 640 kilometres from the nearest railhead — a journey of weeks by oxcart across swamps and rivers. There were no roads, no suppliers, no skilled tradesmen. Everything had to be made on site. Gore-Browne recruited and trained local men as builders, carpenters, and blacksmiths. He experimented with brick colours and tile glazes. Oxen hauled stone panels for the roof, each weighing 2.5 kilograms. First came the main house with its central tower, then the gatehouse with clock tower, colonnaded porticoes, courtyards, a chapel, workers' cottages, schools, a hospital, a post office, playing fields, tennis courts, and formal gardens.</p>

                    <h2>The Man Who Changed Zambia</h2>
                    <p>But Shiwa Ng'andu was never merely a building. Gore-Browne conceived it as a model community in the tradition of Victorian utopian villages like Saltaire and Port Sunlight. Workers lived in brick cottages with their families. Their children attended estate schools. The sick were treated at the estate hospital. The Bemba nicknamed him <em>Chipembere</em> — "the rhinoceros" — for his forceful manner and fiery temper.</p>
                    <p>His isolation from white settler society gave Gore-Browne a perspective few contemporaries shared. Living alongside Africans, depending on them for survival, he came to believe that the country's future lay not in segregation but in partnership. In 1935 he was elected to the Northern Rhodesia Legislative Council, using his position to advocate for African interests with an eloquence that earned him admirers and enemies in equal measure. He was knighted in 1945.</p>
                    <p>After the war, when calls for African independence intensified, Gore-Browne openly championed majority rule while most white settlers opposed it. He became a mentor and financial supporter to the young nationalists <strong>Kenneth Kaunda</strong> and <strong>Harry Nkumbula</strong>, providing funds to send Nkumbula to university in Uganda. Both were regular visitors to Shiwa, where the remote location provided seclusion for sensitive discussions away from colonial surveillance.</p>
                    <p>On the estate stands <strong>Impandala House</strong> — a farmhouse where Kenneth Kaunda was held under house arrest by colonial authorities, and where key discussions took place in the lead-up to independence. The house claims a role in the final signings of documents relating to Zambian independence in 1964.</p>
                    <p>Gore-Browne died in Kasama on 4 August 1967, aged eighty-four. President Kaunda himself delivered the eulogy at his state funeral — the first and only time a white man has received such an honour in Zambian history. Today, two certificates hang side by side in the hallway: one awarding Gore-Browne a knighthood from King George VI; the other, the Companion Order of Freedom from President Kaunda.</p>

                    <h2>What You Will See</h2>
                    <p>Approaching from the Great North Road, you pass through an avenue of eucalyptus trees that feels disconcertingly English. Brick cottages with slate roofs line the road — the workers' housing built a century ago. Then the main house appears: pink-red brick, a central tower with arched windows, colonnaded terraces, formal lawns, flower gardens in riotous colour.</p>
                    <p>The interior is a time capsule. The grand drawing room — green walls, white-painted brick fireplace, classical busts, Persian rugs on hexagonal tiles — looks much as it did in Gore-Browne's day. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves hold thousands of volumes. Family portraits in gilt frames line the walls. The library is darker, more intimate: Gore-Browne's desk, his photograph albums, his diaries. The archives are extraordinary — a century of meticulously documented life on an African estate, available for guests to explore.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>chapel</strong>, a short walk from the main house, is an octagonal room with high clerestory windows, decorative tile panels in blue and white, and a brick-built altar. Services are still held here by candlelight, exactly as they were in Gore-Browne's time.</p>
                    <p>Outside, the estate extends over 12,500 hectares — including Lake Ishiba Ng'andu itself, one of the largest privately owned bodies of water in Africa. Game drives reveal sitatunga, puku, waterbuck, impala, and over 375 species of birds. The <strong>Kapishya Hot Springs</strong>, about twenty minutes' drive from the house, offer natural thermal pools surrounded by raffia palms.</p>

                    <h2>Tragedy and Restoration</h2>
                    <p>After Gore-Browne's death, the estate passed to his daughter Lorna and her husband Major John Harvey. In 1991, Michael Palin visited for the BBC series <em>Pole to Pole</em>. Six months later, in 1992, the Harveys were murdered at Shiwa by three men living in exile from South Africa. Motives remain unclear. The house fell into severe disrepair.</p>
                    <p>But in 1999, Gore-Browne's grandson <strong>Charlie Harvey</strong> and his wife <strong>Jo</strong> took over the estate and began a painstaking restoration. Starting with the roof — a mammoth task — they have gradually returned the house and grounds to their former grandeur. Today Shiwa Ng'andu operates as a guest house, with visitors sleeping in antique-furnished rooms, exploring a century of archives, and experiencing a vanished world preserved in amber.</p>

                    <h2>Getting There</h2>
                    <p>From Mpika, head north on the Great North Road (T2) towards Chinsali. After approximately 80km, turn left (west) at the signposted junction. Follow the dirt road for approximately 12km to the estate. The road is well-maintained and passable by 2WD in dry season; 4x4 advisable in the rains. From Chinsali, the turnoff is approximately 45km south. The estate has its own airstrip for charter flights.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advance booking is essential.</strong> This is a private residence, not a drop-in attraction.</p>

                    <h2>Tips</h2>
                    <ul style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-md);">
                        <li><strong>Stay overnight</strong> — A day visit gives you the house, but staying overnight with candlelit dinner, fireplaces, and evening chapel service is the full experience</li>
                        <li><strong>Bring warm clothing</strong> — The altitude means cold nights, especially May–August; fireplaces are lit, but dress warmly</li>
                        <li><strong>Bring a torch</strong> — Electricity is limited; much of the atmosphere comes from candlelight</li>
                        <li><strong>Visit Kapishya Hot Springs</strong> — Natural thermal pools about twenty minutes away, run by another branch of the family</li>
                        <li><strong>Read "The Africa House"</strong> — Christina Lamb's 1999 biography of Gore-Browne is essential background; reading it on site adds another dimension</li>
                        <li><strong>Engage with the history</strong> — Charlie and Jo Harvey are passionate custodians; ask questions, explore the archives, let them tell the stories</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Suggested Itineraries</h2>
