                        Rusting giants from Glasgow and Manchester sleep in the African sun, their fireboxes cold for half a century. But step inside the first-class carriage in the old locomotive shed and time dissolves: you sit in a mahogany compartment, run your fingers across brass fittings, and feel the spirit of an era when steam hauled copper and colonists across a continent.

                    <h2>The Story</h2>
                    <p>The railway made Livingstone. Before the Victoria Falls Bridge opened in 1905, Livingstone was a frontier settlement, but after it, the town became the railway capital of a vast region — the point where Cecil Rhodes's dream of a Cape-to-Cairo railway finally crossed the Zambezi. For decades, everything that moved into Northern Rhodesia came through Livingstone by rail: mining equipment, manufactured goods, colonial administrators, and settlers. Everything that went out — copper from the Copperbelt, teak from the forests, lead and zinc from Kabwe — left the same way.</p>
                    <p>The Railway Museum occupies the historic locomotive sheds of the <strong>Zambezi Sawmills</strong>, a company founded in 1910 to exploit the vast forests of Rhodesian teak on the north bank of the Zambezi. Teak is hard, strong, and termite-resistant — ideal for railway sleepers — and there was a ready market for it across southern Africa. To get the timber out, the company built its own railway from Livingstone northwest to Mulobezi and eventually to Kataba. At its peak, this was claimed to be <strong>the longest private railway in the world</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The locomotives that hauled the teak were British-built, purchased second-hand from Rhodesia Railways in the 1920s. They had been constructed in Glasgow, Manchester, and Leeds at the turn of the century — one bears a builder's plate from Neilson Reid & Co of Glasgow, dated 1900, predating the Victoria Falls Bridge itself. Converted to burn sawmill waste rather than coal, these engines worked the Mulobezi line until dieselisation killed steam across Zambia in 1971.</p>
                    <p>When the Zambezi Sawmills Company closed in 1973, the locomotives were simply left in the sheds. The site was acquired by the National Monuments Commission in 1976, and in 1987 President Kenneth Kaunda opened the Railway Museum. Here the engines remain, some in reasonable condition, others quietly rusting.</p>

                    <h2>What You Will See</h2>
                    <p>The museum grounds contain a substantial collection of rolling stock distributed across outdoor sidings and the original covered locomotive shed. The outdoor yard holds several steam locomotives in varying states of preservation — some painted in the sky-blue livery of Zambia State Railways, others in the darker tones of Rhodesia Railways. Look for the <strong>builder's plates</strong> on the engines: they read like a roll call of Britain's great locomotive works — Neilson Reid of Glasgow, North British of Edinburgh, Beyer Peacock of Manchester.</p>
                    <p>The locomotives include Class 7 engines dating from the 1890s and early 1900s, Class 10 and Class 12 engines from the 1920s, and at least one massive <strong>Beyer-Garratt articulated locomotive</strong> — the workhorses that hauled heavy loads over the steep gradients of the Rhodesian railway network.</p>
                    <p>But the highlight of the museum is the <strong>Rhodesia Railways first-class carriage</strong> preserved in the old engine shed. You can climb aboard, walk through the corridor with its polished teak panelling and louvred shutters, and sit in one of the compartments. The craftsmanship is extraordinary: mahogany woodwork, brass fittings, silk lampshades, leather upholstery. This is how the colonial elite travelled — in comfort that would not disgrace an Edwardian gentleman's club, while Africa rolled past the windows.</p>
                    <p>The small details reward attention. Brass light switches marked "LOW / BRIGHT" and "FAN ON". A porcelain toilet with a mahogany seat. The <em>"3rd & 4th Class Waiting Room"</em> sign — a stark reminder that colonial railways were segregated spaces, with African passengers confined to the most basic accommodation while Europeans travelled in luxury.</p>

                    <h2>Gateway Jewish Museum</h2>
                    <p>The museum also houses the <strong>Gateway Jewish Museum</strong>, documenting the significant contribution of Jewish settlers to Livingstone's development. Jews arrived from the 1890s, many fleeing persecution in Lithuania via South Africa. They established businesses, contributed to the timber trade, and became part of the fabric of colonial Livingstone. The exhibition includes photographs, documents, and personal stories of families whose descendants still live in the region.</p>

                    <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
                    <p>The railway was the instrument of colonial penetration — it made copper mining profitable, enabled administrative control of the territory, and reshaped the geography of settlement. Understanding the railway is essential to understanding how modern Zambia came into being.</p>
                    <p>The locomotives themselves are significant survivors. Steam traction ended in Zambia in 1971, and most engines were scrapped. The Livingstone collection — perhaps a dozen locomotives in various conditions — represents the <strong>largest surviving concentration of Zambian steam heritage</strong>. The British-built engines, manufactured by companies that no longer exist, are tangible links to the global industrial economy of the early twentieth century.</p>

                    <h2>Living Steam: The Royal Livingstone Express</h2>
                    <p>Adjacent to the museum, the Bushtracks company operates the <strong>Royal Livingstone Express</strong>, a heritage steam train that runs to the Victoria Falls Bridge. Two of the working locomotives — No. 156 and No. 204 — were rescued and restored, No. 156 by the wildlife artist David Shepherd. Passengers can experience steam traction as it once was: the smell of coal smoke, the rhythm of the exhaust beat, the views from the observation car as the train crosses the gorge. This is living heritage rather than museum heritage — a reminder that these engines were built to work, not to stand idle.</p>

                    <h2>Getting There</h2>
                    <p>The museum is on Chishimba Falls Road (also known as the Mulobezi Road), approximately 2km from the centre of Livingstone. From the main Mosi-oa-Tunya Road, turn west at the signed junction. The museum is on the right, well signposted. Any taxi or tour operator in Livingstone will know it.</p>

                    <h2>Tips for Your Visit</h2>
                    <p><strong>Ask the guide to unlock the first-class carriage</strong> if it's closed — stepping inside is the highlight of the visit. <strong>Examine the builder's plates</strong> on the locomotives; some date to the 1890s. The covered shed is cooler and more atmospheric than the outdoor yard; don't skip it.</p>
                    <p>Allow at least an hour, longer if you're interested in railways or industrial history. Combine with the <strong>Livingstone Museum</strong> (Zambia's oldest and largest) in the same morning or afternoon.</p>

                    <h2>Suggested Itineraries</h2>
                    <p><strong>Livingstone Heritage Morning (3–4 hours):</strong> Railway Museum → Livingstone Museum → lunch in town. Covers colonial history from transport to ethnography.</p>
                    <p><strong>Railway and Falls (half-day):</strong> Railway Museum in the morning, Victoria Falls in the afternoon. The museum provides context for the bridge you'll walk across at the Falls.</p>
                    <p><strong>Living Steam Experience:</strong> Combine the static museum with a trip on the Royal Livingstone Express (operated by Bushtracks, advance booking required). See heritage steam in action, with sunset drinks on the Victoria Falls Bridge.</p>
