                        Many Lusakans walk past this building every day without a second glance. But look closer at the wall beside the main window. There's a small rectangular outline, bricked up but still visible: the sealed frame of a second, smaller opening. This is the "hatch" — the window through which Black Africans were required to buy their railway tickets while white passengers walked inside. The segregation window has been sealed for decades, but its outline remains — a scar in the brickwork, hiding in plain sight.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>The Story</h2>
                    <p>Lusaka began as a railway siding. In 1905, the British South Africa Company was pushing its Cape to Cairo railway northward through Northern Rhodesia, connecting the copper mines of the Copperbelt to the ports of South Africa. The line needed water stops for its steam engines, and the spot where a Lenje chief named Lusaaka had his village — blessed with reliable water sources — was chosen as one such stop.</p>
                    <p>The railway arrived in 1905. By 1906, the Njanji building had been constructed as a station house — a place where passengers could buy tickets and wait for trains. It was a modest structure: single-storey, red-orange brick, a corrugated iron roof with decorative gables, a covered veranda running its length. Typical colonial railway architecture, functional rather than grand.</p>
                    <p>But the building's design encoded the racial hierarchy of the colony. White passengers entered through the door, bought their tickets at the counter inside, and waited in the sheltered foyer. Black Africans were served through a small external window — a "hatch" or "pigeonhole" in the language of the time — forced to conduct their business from outside, regardless of weather.</p>

                    <h2>The Colour Bar</h2>
                    <p>This was the <strong>colour bar</strong>: the system of racial segregation that pervaded every aspect of life in Northern Rhodesia. It was never as formalised as South African apartheid — there were few written laws mandating separation — but it was enforced through custom, architecture, and social pressure. Shops served Europeans inside while Africans queued at external hatches. Post offices had separate windows. Hotels, restaurants, and public facilities were effectively whites-only.</p>
                    <p>The colour bar was a central grievance of the independence movement. When Harry Nkumbula and Kenneth Kaunda built the Northern Rhodesia African National Congress in the early 1950s, ending racial discrimination was a core demand. In 1956, the matter was raised in the British Parliament, where an MP described Northern Rhodesia as having "social colour bar, racial discrimination, intimidation and ostracism... worse than those being experienced in the Union of South Africa."</p>
                    <p>The railway station at this site was eventually replaced by the larger Lusaka Railway Station across the road. The Njanji building survived, repurposed over the decades. At some point — the date is unrecorded — the segregation window was sealed, plastered over, its shameful purpose erased from active use but not from the fabric of the building.</p>

                    <h2>What You Will See</h2>
                    <p>The Njanji Commuter Building stands on the southern edge of Heroes Square, directly opposite the main Lusaka Railway Station. It's easily overlooked — a single-storey brick structure with a green corrugated roof, partially obscured by fencing and signage for the bus company that now occupies it.</p>
                    <p>The most historically significant feature is on the front façade: <strong>the sealed segregation window</strong>. Look at the wall to the right of the main window. You'll see a rectangular outline — smaller than the main opening, roughly chest-height — where the brickwork has been filled in and plastered. This is the "hatch" through which Black passengers were served during the colonial period. The outline remains clearly visible, a physical remnant of institutionalised racism.</p>
                    <p>The building's colonial-era features include: <strong>brick construction</strong> (orange-red bricks, typical of early Northern Rhodesian colonial buildings), <strong>corrugated iron roof</strong> (green-painted, with decorative gable ends), <strong>colonnaded veranda</strong> (running the length of the building, with brick columns painted in distinctive orange and white), and <strong>original window frames</strong> (six-pane casement windows with white-painted surrounds).</p>

                    <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
                    <p><strong>Lusaka's oldest building:</strong> The Njanji Commuter Building, constructed in 1906, is the earliest surviving building in Lusaka. When it was built, "Lusaka" was not yet a town — just a railway siding and water stop. The Njanji building is the sole survivor from this founding moment. Every other structure from 1905–1910 has been demolished or replaced. The city that grew up around the line, that became the colonial capital in 1935 and the national capital in 1964, has no older built heritage.</p>
                    <p><strong>The colour bar in brick and mortar:</strong> The sealed window is not merely an architectural detail — it's a material record of the colour bar system that shaped daily life in Northern Rhodesia. The "hatch system" was pervasive, requiring no legislation — it was simply built into the architecture, normalised through design. When independence came in 1964, the hatches were sealed, the signs removed. But the buildings themselves often survived, their discriminatory features plastered over but not erased.</p>
                    <p><strong>Railway heritage:</strong> The building also represents Zambia's railway heritage. The Cape to Cairo railway — Cecil Rhodes' imperial dream — created Lusaka and connected the Copperbelt to the world. Railway architecture from this period is increasingly rare; most early stations have been demolished or rebuilt.</p>

                    <h2>Getting There</h2>
                    <p>The Njanji Commuter Building is located on Heroes Square in central Lusaka, directly opposite the main entrance to Lusaka Railway Station. It's easily reached by taxi or on foot from anywhere in the central business district. Landmarks nearby include the Freedom Statue.</p>

                    <h2>Tips for Your Visit</h2>
                    <p><strong>Look for the sealed window:</strong> The building's most significant feature is easy to miss. Stand on the pavement facing the front façade and look at the wall to the right of the main window. The rectangular outline of the sealed hatch is clearly visible.</p>
                    <p><strong>Combine with railway station:</strong> The main Lusaka Railway Station, directly opposite, has its own heritage interest — colonial-era buildings, working railway yard, and occasional passenger services. <strong>Visit Heroes Square:</strong> The square itself commemorates Zambian history; the Freedom Statue and other monuments are nearby.</p>
                    <p><strong>Morning light is best</strong> for photography, as it illuminates the front façade; afternoon sun is behind the building. <strong>Manage expectations:</strong> This is a modest, workaday building still in commercial use. There's no interpretation, no museum, no visitor facilities. Its significance lies in what it represents, not in any curated experience.</p>

                    <h2>Suggested Itineraries</h2>
